# VRBookcaseSeniorProject

Original Project Date: April 26, 2021

A small little sidescroller game in VR that includes a level editor implemented with virtual bookcases spawned in/out to display objects to the users. The project was done using Unreal Engine 4.26 with Blueprints. The project has been configured for Android to run on the Oculus Quest 2, but runs just fine on Windows through the Unreal Engine editor. Key files for running on Android are missing from this repository because of Github space restrictions, but launching in Unreal would recreate the missing files anyway.

This was my senior project completed at Dixe State University. This project is an excellent example of my knowledge of inheritence, polymorphism, interfaces, and good use of functions. This project also demonstrates my ability to build something from the ground-up.
