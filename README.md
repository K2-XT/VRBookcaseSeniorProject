# VRBookcaseSeniorProject

A small little sidescroller game in VR that includes a level editor implemented with virtual bookcases spawned in/out to display objects to the users.

This was my senior project completed at Dixe State University. This project is an excellent example of my knowledge of inheritence, polymorphism, interfaces, and good use of functions. This project also demonstrates my ability to build something from the ground-up.
